Large items should not be \\nmore than half of the total load.\\n• The washer can be fully loaded, but the drum \\nshould not be tightly pa cked with items. The \\ndoor of the washer must close easily.\\n• The washer will not fill or operate with the door \\nopen.\\nCAUTION\\n• Clothing or articles that are waterproof or water-\\nresistant must be washed in the Waterproof , \\nBedding , Bulky/Large , or Jumbo Wash  cycle \\nonly. (Examples include w ater resistant clothing, \\nmattress covers, outdoor clothes, and plastic \\nmats.) Failure to do so may result in personal \\ninjury or damage to the washer, clothes, walls, \\nfloor, and surrounding objects due to abnormal \\nvibration.\\nBulky Items\\n• Wash thick, bulky items individually. Heavy \\nblankets, comforters, be dspreads, or pet beds \\ncan get tangled or cause an unbalanced load if \\ncombined with other items.\\nSmall Items\\n• Do not wash a single small item. Add enough \\nsimilar items to the load to prevent an out-of-\\nbalance load.\\n• Wash small, light items in a mesh bag. Small \\nitems can get caught in the impeller at the bottom of the drum, and brassiere hooks can \\nsnag on other clothing or the drum.\\nAdding Cleaning Products\\nAbout Detergent Use\\nThis washer is designed for use with only HE (High-Efficiency) detergents.\\n• HE detergents produce fewer suds, dissolve \\nmore efficiently to improve washing and rinsing \\nperformance, and help to  keep the interior of \\nthe washer clean. Using detergent that is not HE \\nmay cause oversudsing and unsatisfactory \\nperformance which could result in error codes, \\ncycle failure, and washer damage.\\n• Detergents designated as HE-compatible may \\nnot provide optimal results.\\n• For proper wash performance, always measure \\ndetergent using the measuring device provided \\nby the detergent manufacturer. For an average load, use less than half of the recommended \\nmaximum. Use less detergent for soft water, \\nlight soil, or smaller loads.\\n• Use extra care when measuring 2X and 3X \\nconcentrated detergents because even a small \\namount of extra detergen t can lead to problems.\\n• Never use more than the maximum amount of \\ndetergent recommended by the manufacturer. Using too much detergent can lead to \\noversudsing, poor rinsin g, detergent buildup in \\nclothing, and residue buildup that can contribute \\nto odors in the washer.\\n• Do not use more than on e single-use detergent \\npack in the washer. Us ing too much detergent \\nmay cause oversudsing and unsatisfactory \\nperformance. Reduce de tergent amount or add \\nan extra rinse if detergent residue is left on fabrics. To add an ex tra rinse, select the Extra \\nRinse  option.\\naMaximum fill line\\nbAverage load fill line\\ncLiquid detergent ', metadata={'source': './downloaded_file.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='22 OPERATION\\ndPowdered detergent\\nSingle-Use Detergent Packs / Gel or \\nTablet Detergents\\nPlace liquid or powdered detergent packs, or gel \\nor tablet detergents in the drum before loading \\nlaundry.

If the washer does not function properly or does not function at all,  check the following before \\nyou call for service.\\nFAQs\\nError MessagesQ: Why does my washer make loud banging noises while it is filling with water?\\nA: This is actually a problem with the plumbing in yo ur home. When the water va lve in the washer shuts \\noff, it can cause pipes in your home to move, resulting in a loud banging noise. This effect, called water hammer, can be reduced by  installing an item called a water hammer arrestor. Add-on \\narrestors can be purchased through your local hardware or home improvement store.\\nQ: Why is there so little water in my washer? How can it clean the clothes?\\nA: HE (High-Efficiency) washers are designed to pr operly wash your laundry while using a minimum \\namount of water and energy. Because the water volume  is low, the small amount of detergent used is \\nmore concentrated in the water, result ing in excellent cleaning performance.\\nQ: When I press a button, why does my washer beep and then nothing happens?\\nA: The Control Lock  feature is turned on. To turn it off, tu rn on the washer, then press and hold the \\nbutton that has Control Lock  on or under it for 3 seconds .\\nQ: Where should I pour powdered laund ry products when doing my laundry?\\nA: If you are using powdered laundry detergent, load it in the main detergent dispense r after removing \\nthe liquid detergent insert.

Instead of \\narbitration, either party may bring an  individual action in small claims  court, but that small claims court \\naction may not be brought on a class or representative basis.\\nArbitration Rules and Procedures.  To begin arbitration of a claim, ei ther you or LG must make a written \\ndemand for arbitration. The arbitrati on will be administered by the American Arbitration Association \\n(“AAA”) and will be conducted before a single arbitr ator under the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules that \\nare in effect at the time the arbi tration is initiated (referred to as the “AAA Rules”) and under the \\nprocedures set forth in this section. The AAA Rules are available online at www.a dr.org/consumer. Send a \\ncopy of your written demand for arbitration, as well as  a copy of this provision, to the AAA in the manner \\ndescribed in the AAA Rules. You must also send a copy  of your written demand to LG at LG Electronics, \\nUSA, Inc. Attn: Legal Department-Arbitration 111 Sylvan  Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632. If there is a \\nconflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in this section, the rules set forth in this section will \\ngovern. This arbitration provision is  governed by the Federa l Arbitration Act. Judgme nt may be entered on \\nthe arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction. All issues  are for the arbitrator to decide, \\nexcept that issues relating to th e scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision and to the \\narbitrability of the dispute are fo r the court to decide. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this \\nprovision.\\nGoverning Law.  The law of the state of yo ur residence shall govern this Limite d Warranty and any \\ndisputes between us except to the extent that such law is preempted by  or inconsistent with applicable \\nfederal law.\\nFees/Costs.  You do not need to pay any fee to begin an ar bitration. Upon receipt of  your written demand \\nfor arbitration, LG will promptly pay all arbitration fi ling fees to the AAA unless yo u seek more than $25,000 \\nin damages, in which case the paym ent of these fees will be govern ed by the AAA Rules. Except as \\notherwise provided for herein, LG will pay all AAA filing, administration an d arbitrator fees for any \\narbitration initiated in accord ance with the AAA Rules and this arbitration provision. If you prevail in the \\narbitration, LG will pay your attorney s’ fees and expenses as long as they are reasonable, by considering \\nfactors including, but not limited to, the purchase  amount and claim amou nt. Notwithstanding the \\nforegoing, if applicable law allows  for an award of reason able attorneys’ fe es and expenses, an arbitrator \\ncan award them to the same extent th at a court would. If the arbitrator finds either the substance of your \\nclaim or the relief sought in the de mand is frivolous or brought for an  improper purpose (as measured by \\nthe standards set forth in Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all arbitration fees will \\nbe governed by the AAA Rules. In such a situation, you agree to reimburse LG for all monies previously \\ndisbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise \\nprovided for, LG waives any rights it may have to seek  attorneys’ fees and expenses  from you if LG prevails \\nin the arbitration.\\nHearings and Location.  If your claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose to ha ve the arbitration \\nconducted solely on the basis of (1) documents submitted to the arbi trator, (2) throug h a telephonic \\nhearing, or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $25,000, the \\nright to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearings will be held at a \\nlocation within the federal judicial district in which you reside unless we both agree to another location or we agree to a telephonic arbitration.\\nOpt Out.  You may opt out of this dispute resolution proc edure. If you opt out, neither you nor LG can \\nrequire the other to participate in an  arbitration proceeding.

      "A: This is actually a problem with the plumbing in yo ur home. When the water va lve in the washer shuts \n",

      "A: HE (High-Efficiency) washers are designed to pr operly wash your laundry while using a minimum \n",

      "more concentrated in the water, result ing in excellent cleaning performance.\n",
